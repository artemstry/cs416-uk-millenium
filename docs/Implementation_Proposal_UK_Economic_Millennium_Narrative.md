## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning and Standardization**
   ```javascript
   // Convert sparse medieval data to consistent format
   // Handle missing values and interpolation
   // Standardize units and currencies
   // Create composite indices for comparison
   ```

2. **Key Indicators Extraction**
   ```javascript
   const keyIndicators = {
     gdpReal: 'Real GDP composite estimate',
     population: 'Population (GB+NI)',
     prices: 'Consumer price index',
     wages: 'Real consumption wages',
     government: 'Public sector spending %',
     trade: 'Trade deficit/surplus',
     finance: 'Interest rates, money supply'
   };
   ```

3. **Change Point Detection Algorithm**
   ```javascript
   // Identify periods of dramatic change
   // Calculate growth rate accelerations
   // Flag crisis periods and recoveries
   // Generate narrative transition points
   ```
